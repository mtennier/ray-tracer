# ray-tracer

Ray tracer I did for a CSC class. I added multithreading which is cool!

Written on Python 3.12.

External libraries: Numpy 1.26.1

You can create a virtual environment to help with running things!

### To create:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

### To run:
Windows: 
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Unix/MacOS: 
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Then to install the requirements:
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To deactivate the virtual environment (once done running the ray tracer)
```
deactivate
```
### To run the ray tracer:
```
python3 RayTracer.py [path/to/filename.txt]
```

### To run all cases:
```
bash all_tests.sh
```
